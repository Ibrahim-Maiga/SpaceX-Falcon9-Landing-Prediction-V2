## Acknowledgments
This project is based on [IBM Applied Data Science Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone), created by [Joseph Santarcangelo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-s-50398b136/), [Yan Luo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yan-luo-96288783/), and [Nayef Abou Tayoun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nayefaboutayoun/)

The original project served as a solid foundation for my work, which I have further developed with key enhancements. This adaptation includes an updated dataset, expanding the original data range from 2010–2020 to now cover up to 2024, and additional model benchmarks. While the original project compared the performance of SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression, I’ve introduced two more machine learning models, Random Forest and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), to provide a broader performance analysis. Special thanks to the original creators for their excellent work!

## Project
On its website, SpaceX promotes Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of 62 million dollars. In contrast,
other providers charge upwards of 165 million dollars for each launch. One of the reasons for the
significant cost difference is that SpaceX can reuse the first stage of the rocket. Therefore, if we can
accurately predict whether the first stage will land successfully, we can determine the cost of a
launch.

We will use public information to predict whether SpaceX will reuse the first stage (Booster) by
training five different machine learning models and evaluating them using information from various
sources about SpaceX.

In order to determine the price of each SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launch, we will assess the likelihood
of a successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage.
